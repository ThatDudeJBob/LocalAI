Welcome to LocalAI (LLM) engineâ€”a powerful tool designed for local machine use, ensuring data security by eliminating the need to upload information to OpenAI servers.

**Key Features:**
- **GPT-4 Model:** Harness the capabilities of the advanced GPT-4 language model for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
- **LangChain Integration:** Utilizes LangChain to access a vector store database, allowing easy customization by adding documents to the "data/" directory. Supported file formats include .txt, .pdf, .csv, .xls, .html, and more.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Modify the API key: Replace the default OpenAI key with your own to enable seamless integration with the GPT-4 engine.
2. Adjust Model Configuration: Depending on your OpenAI subscription limits, choose between "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "davinci-text-003" as the model. If you have access to GPT-4, simply add your API key and run the bot.

**Cost-Efficient and Customizable:**
- **No Subscription Required:** Bypass the need for an OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription, saving you from a $20 monthly fee.
- **Custom Libraries:** Duplicate and customize the folder and file to create your own "Custom GPTs," tailored to specific scopes.
- **Local Processing:** Enjoy the benefits of running models locally, eliminating the need to upload personal data to OpenAI.
